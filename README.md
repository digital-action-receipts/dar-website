# Receipts for Digital Actions

This repository contains the website and reference materials for a system that issues
verifiable receipts for digital actions.

A digital action receipt is a neutral, append-only record that an action occurred,
created at the moment of execution and independently verifiable later — without
requiring access to internal logs, screenshots, or tightly coupled systems.

## What this is
- A reference implementation and public-facing website
- Documentation describing digital action receipts and verification
- Early prototype materials demonstrating receipt issuance and verification

## What this is not
- A monitoring or analytics platform
- A compliance product
- A log aggregation system
- A replacement for existing workflows

## Status
This project is in early development.
The focus is on clarity, correctness, and minimal surface area.

More documentation will be added as the system evolves.
